            <p class="press-text">Judy is a kind, strong and gentle practitioner who works from the heart. She gave me a beautiful overall chi and chakra balancing, along with uplifting reminders of spiritual wisdom. I think her work would be so supportive for many healers, professionals, givers and caregivers who could use some chi balancing, a heartfelt pick-me-up, and a way to deepen their own growth. I deeply recommend her.</p>

            <p class="press-text upper-space">I spent many hours gardening over the weekend, which lead to a very sore lower back and limbs. It felt like I would need a month to recover. I had one chi-gong session with Judy, and surprisingly, all the pain subsided within 2 days. Judy’s heartfelt gentle healing approach was amazing, and I truly recommend her if you wish fast relief of pain.</p>

            <p class="press-text upper-space">I started Qigong/energy healing sessions with Judy to support my thyroid, and the improvement has been incredible. Not only have my thyroid levels stabilized, but my overthinking and anxiety have reduced significantly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Every session begins with tension, brain fog, and mental clutter, but by the end I feel grounded, calm, and like a lighter version of myself. Even though the focus is on thyroid healing, the mental clarity and emotional relief I experience each time are just as powerful.
            <br>
            <br>
            She is patient, caring, and genuinely gifted. I'm truly grateful for her support and highly recommend her to anyone needing physical, emotional, or energetic healing.</p>

            <p class="press-text upper-space">Thank you so much Judy for sharing your wonderful healing method with me. From the moment our session started I felt safe and comfortable with your approach. My Rt knee was quite swollen and stiff about 6 weeks after surgery and there was a large build up of scar tissue. As you were sending the energy to me the scar tissue in my knee started to tingle. After several treatments the swelling was decreased Our sessions also helped my emotional health as I had been feeling discouraged and worried. Your friendly competent manner improved my state of mind. Thank you again for the remote Fa Chi healings.</p>
